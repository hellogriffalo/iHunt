A Socialite knows the rules, and when to bend them, and who they really apply to. For this reason, they’re often good at talking themselves out of uncomfortable faux pas.

A Social Worker can help a person cope, connect with the necessary services to get by, and ultimately stand in their corner when nobody else will. A Social Worker is the duct tape that keeps a broken life from falling apart all over the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s some overlap with Organizers here.

Investigators can pierce this veil if they know what to look for. If you need to get someone surveilled without drawing attention, you contact a Spy.
